This is a basic enemy avoidance game.  Gameplay involves shooting enemies to earn 
money and upgrade the player's weapon.  The enemies plot paths around walls using 
a heuristic-based depth-first search and a path-trimming function.  The player can 
place and remove walls before starting the game.

To run, simply place the project file, Help folder, and Images folder in the same 
directory and then run the code.
